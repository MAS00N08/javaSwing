# Java Swing Application

An application created in Java using the Swing libraries. The app walks through the basics of Java Swing and how to create  a similar application.

## Running

The application is available as either a .java file or a .jar file.
The .jar file is easier to run, but the .java file is also available if you want to see the code.
Both files require java to be installed on your system
The .java would have to be run using either an IDE or a command terminal.
When installing, you need all of the folders it is contained in. The image folder is important, and the code needs to be in the folders it is written in.
